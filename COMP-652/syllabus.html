<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>
The goal of this class is to provide an overview of the state-of-art algorithms used in machine learning. The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that improve automatically with experience. In recent years, many successful applications of machine learning have been developed, ranging from data-mining programs that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, to autonomous vehicles that learn to drive on public highways, and computer vision programs that can recognize thousands of different object types. At the same time, there have been important advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. During this course, we will study both the theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms and their practical applications.

</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

Basic knowledge of a programming language is required. Knowledge
of probabilities/statistics, calculus and linear algebra is required.  Example courses at
McGill providing sufficient background in probability are MATH-323 or ECSE-305.  Some
AI background is recommended, as provided, for instance by COMP-424 or
ECSE-526, but not required.  If you have doubts regarding your background, please contact Doina to discuss it.

<h3>Reference Materials</h3>

There is no required textbook.  However, there are several good machine learning textbooks describing parts of the material that we will cover.  The schedule will include recommended reading, either from these books, or from research papers, as appropriate.

<h3>Class Requirements</h3>

The class grade will be based on the following components:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Three assignments - 30%. The assignments will contain a mix of
theoretical and experimental questions.  <br>
</li>
<li>A final project - 30%.
</li>
<li>A final in-class examination - 40%.
</li>
<li>Participation in class discussions - up to 1% extra credit.
</li>
</ol>
Minor changes to the evaluation scheme (if any) will be announced in
class by September 19 (pending in-class discussion and the
estimated total enrollment).
<p>
<hr>
</p>

<h3>Homework Policy</h3>

<p>
Assignments should be submitted <b><u>electronically</u></b> on the day when
they are due, through <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/mycourses">MyCourses</a>.
For late assignments, 10 points
will be deducted from the grade for every late day, for the first 5
days.  <b><u>No credit is given for assignments submitted more than 5
days late, unless you have a documented problem.</u></b>
</p>
<p>
<b><u>All assignments are INDIVIDUAL!</u></b> You may discuss the
problems with your colleagues, but you must submit individual
homeworks.  Please acknowledge all sources you use in the homeworks
(papers, code or ideas from someone else).  
</p>
<p>
McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students
must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism
and other academic offenses under the Code of Student Conduct and
Disciplinary Procedures (see <a
href="http://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest">www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest</a> for
more information).
</p>
<p>
In accord with McGill University's Charter of Students'  Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.
</p>
<p>
In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University's control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.
