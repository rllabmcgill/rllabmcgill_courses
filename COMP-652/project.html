<center><h2>Project</h2></center>

<p>
<h3>Goal</h3>

The main goal of the project for this course is to encourage you to experiment
with some of the machine learning methods that we discussed in class, in the
context of problems that are of interest to you.  

<p><h3>Requirements</h3></p>
<p>
The project is to be completed either individually or in groups of two-three 
students.  Students who are working for their research on problems that are 
amenable to machine learning solutions are strongly encouraged to formulate
a project related to their work.  Students who do not have such problems
should contact us to discuss possible projects.
<p>
All students will be required to write a project report, and to do a final 
project poster presentation.  The poster session will be scheduled in November (<u>tentative schedule 
Nov. 26 and/or 28, from 2pm to 5pm</u>) and the projects will be due shortly thereafter.  </p>
<p>
By October 30, you should upload a pdf file with the title and a one-paragraph abstract of your project on MyCourses (or send it by mail to both Riashat and Audrey
if you don't have access to MyCourses). For team projects, each member should upload the same document.  The abstract should make it 
clear what your goal is, what resources (data, software, papers) you will use, and
what we should expect to see at the end of the project.  A typical project
will involve reading 2-3 papers and experimenting with machine learning 
algorithms on some interesting data set.  You are strongly encouraged to use
existing resources (e.g. software) and not to re-implement existing algorithms
if it is not necessary.</p>
<p>
The report should contain the following components:
<ol>
<li>An introduction/motivation section, in which you explain why the problem you 
are about to address is interesting and challenging
</li>
<li>
A section describing the basic approach that you will take.  You should assume that
algorithms we discuss in class (e.g. SVMs, HMMs etc.) are known, but summarize
any algorithms that would not have been discussed in class.
</li>
<li>
A section describing the experimental setup.  Here you describe your data set, along
with any pre-processing steps that you might have taken (e.g. to remove noise, select
attributes etc.).  You should describe this in <b><u>enough detail that someone with 
access to your data could exactly reproduce the results</u></b>.  
</li>
<li>
A section describing your results, along with a discussion of what you observed. 
It is important to ensure that you perform your experiments in such a way that 
results are meaningful (e.g., make sure you use cross-validation and report test 
set results).  If you use statistical testing to assess the signifcance of your results,
make sure that the test you choose is appropriate for your data.  If appropriate, report
running time and memory in addition to performance.
</li
<li>
A section containing conclusions and possible future work directions.  
</li>
<li>A section of references</li>
</ol>
There is no set format for the report, use your favorite.  There are also no fixed
length requirements - you should just make sure that you give the right amount of 
information for someone to understand what you did.  In the past, reports have averaged 8-10
pages in single-column format, but use this number just as a guideline.  We expect that 
many of you will be working with very interesting and challenging data.  As a result, the 
goal of the grading would be to assess your competence in applying machine learning methods 
to a specific problem, and not to see a set level of performance.  
You need to ensure that you <b><u> reference all sources appropriately</u></b> (software, papers, ideas from colleagues etc).
<br><br>
To get an idea of what the project and report can be, here are a few project reports from last semester:
<ul>
<li> Nicolas A. Gontier, <a href="project-reports/report.nicolas.gontier.pdf"> Training a Discriminator to Compare Generative Dialogue Models </a></li>
<li> Sumana Basu, <a href="project-reports/report.sumana.basu.pdf"> Synthesis of Gadolinium-enhanced MRI for Multiple
Sclerosis patients using Generative Adversarial Network </a></li>
<li> Peter Henderson, <a href="project-reports/report.peter.henderson.pdf">Using YOLO and Recurrent Layers for
Visual-Servoing in Underwater Environments</a></li>
<li> Charles Onu, <a href="project-reports/report.charles.onu.pdf">Markov-based Modeling of Respiratory Patterns for
Prediction of Extubation Readiness in Preterm Newborns</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The <b><u>poster</u></b> should be A0 format (either portrait or landscape, as you prefer). You should prepare a 5 minutes presentation of your poster.
You should motivate 
your topic, present the general approach, the results, provide a discussion, and point out future works.  Please <b><u>upload the poster along with your report</u></b>.  Both documents (report and poster) should be in pdf format.  

<!-- should be 8 minutes long, with 2 minutes allowed for 
questions.  This means that you could go over 8 slides at most, including your title slide.  
For such a short presentation, you do not need an outline slide.  You should motivate 
your topic, present the general approach, the results and a short discussion, and have a 
conclusion/future work slide.  Please <b><u>upload the presentation along with your report</u></b>.  Both documents (report and presentation) should be in pdf format.
